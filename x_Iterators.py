# Technically, in Python, an iterator is an
# object which implements the iterator
# protocol, which consist of the methods
# __iter__() and __next__().


# Example 1 from a tuple
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
myit = iter(mytuple)

print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))

# Example 2 from a string

mystr = "Apple"
myit2 = iter(mystr)

print(next(myit2))
print(next(myit2))
print(next(myit2))
print(next(myit2))
print(next(myit2))

# Looping through an iteration. Through a tuple
mytuple = ("apples","bananas","mangos")
for i in mytuple:
    print(i)
    
# Create an iterator w/ StopIteration
